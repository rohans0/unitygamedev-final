## Team Reflection
__What went well: __ Our teamwork process was quite refined from the start of this project, which really assisted in helping things run smoothly while only meeting in-person 2 times per week. Generally, we would brainstorm a list of tasks along with a deadline, then divide the work evenly. After that, we would do our independent work then consolidate it all about a day before our deadline. We also all shared a passion for the project which helped to keep us motivated throughout the process.

**What went wrong: ** We struggled with a bit of burnout towards the end of the quarter, likely because we were so passionate and willing to work plenty on the project throughout the beginning and middle of the quarter. Luckily, we were still able to push through and meet all of our goals by the end of the quarter. We also struggled a lot with anticipating how players would act in our game, and often had issues because they would play far differently than we anticipated.

**Group takeaways: ** If we were to work as a group again, we would do a few things differently. First, we would try to pace ourselves out more and set attainable goals to avoid burnout. Second, and most importantly, we would playtest more often and earlier. We think that if we took more opportunities to let players try out our game, even if it is to test the smallest of mechanics, would allow us to get a better sense for how players would react to our changes.
